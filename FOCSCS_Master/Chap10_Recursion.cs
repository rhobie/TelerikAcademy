    //1. Write a program to simulate n nested loops from 1 to n.
    //2. Write a program to generate all variations with duplicates of n elements class k. Sample input:
    //n = 3
    //k = 2
    //Sample output:
    //(1 1), (1 2), (1 3), (2 1), (2 2), (2 3), (3 1), (3 2), (3 3)
    //Think about and implement an iterative algorithm for the same task.
    //3. Write a program to generate and print all combinations with duplicates of k elements from a set with n elements. Sample input:
    //Chapter 10. Recursion 379
    //n = 3
    //k = 2
    //Sample output:
    //(1 1), (1 2), (1 3), (2 2), (2 3), (3 3)
    //Think about and implement an iterative algorithm for the same task.
    //4. You are given a set of strings. Write a recursive program, which generates all subsets, consisting exactly k strings chosen among the elements of this set. Sample input:
    //strings = {'test', 'rock', 'fun'}
    //k = 2
    //Sample output:
    //(test rock), (test fun), (rock fun)
    //Think about and implement an iterative algorithm as well.
    //5. Write a recursive program, which prints all subsets of a given set of N words. Example input:
    //words = {'test', 'rock', 'fun'}
    //Example output:
    //(), (test), (rock), (fun), (test rock), (test fun),
    //(rock fun), (test rock fun)
    //Think about and implement an iterative algorithm for the same task.
    //6. Implement the merge-sort algorithm recursively. In it the initial array is divided into two equal in size parts, which are sorted (recursively via merge-sort) and after that the two sorted parts are merged in order to get the whole sorted array.
    //7. Write a recursive program, which generates and prints all permutations of the numbers 1, 2, …, n, for a given integer n. Example input:
    //n = 3
    //Example output:
    //(1, 2, 3), (1, 3, 2), (2, 1, 3), (2, 3, 1), (3, 1, 2), (3, 2, 1)
    //Try to find an iterative solution for generating permutations.
    //8. You are given an array of integers and a number N. Write a recursive program that finds all subsets of numbers in the array, which have a sum N. For example, if we have the array {2, 3, 1, -1} and N=4, we can obtain N=4 as a sum in the following two ways: 4=2+3-1; 4=3+1.
    //9. You are given an array of positive integers. Write a program that checks whether there is one or more numbers in the array (subset), whose sum is equal to S. Can you solve the task efficiently for large arrays?
    //10. You are given a matrix with passable and impassable cells. Write a recursive program that finds all paths between two cells in the matrix.
    //11. Implement the algorithm BFS (breadth-first search) for finding the shortest path in a labyrinth.
    //12. Modify the previous program to check whether a path exists between two cells without finding all possible paths. Test the program with a matrix 100x100 filled only with passable cells.
    //13. You are given a matrix with passable and impassable cells. Write a program that finds the largest area of neighboring passable cells.
    //14. Write a recursive program that traverses the whole hard disk C:\ recursively and prints all folders and files.
