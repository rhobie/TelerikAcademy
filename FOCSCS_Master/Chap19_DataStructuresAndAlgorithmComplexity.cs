    //1. Hash-tables do not allow storing more than one value in a key. How can we get around this restriction? Define a class to hold multiple values in a hash-table.
    //2. Implement a data structure, which can quickly do the following two operations: add an element and extract the smallest element. The structure should accept adding duplicated elements.
    //3. It is given a text file students.txt containing information about students and their specialty in the following format:
    //Steven Davis | Computer Science
    //Joseph Johnson | Software Engeneering
    //Helen Mitchell | Public Relations
    //Nicolas Carter | Computer Science
    //Susan Green | Public Relations
    //William Johnson | Software Engeneering
    //Using SortedDictionary<K,T> print on the console the specialties in an alphabetical order and for each of them print the names of the students, firstly sorted by family name and secondly – by first name, as shown:
    //Computer Sciences: Nicolas Carter, Steven Davis
    //Public Relations: Susan Green, Helen Mitchell
    //804 Fundamentals of Computer Programming with C#
    //Software Engeneering: Joseph Johnson, William Johnson
    //4. Implement a class BiDictionary<K1,K2,T>, which allows adding triplets {key1, key2, value} and quickly search by either of the keys key1, key2 as well as searching by combination of the both keys. Note: Adding many elements with the same keys is allowed.
    //5. A big chain of supermarkets sell millions of products. Each of them has a unique number (barcode), producer, name and price. What data structure could we use in order to quickly find all products, which cost between 5 and 10 dollars?
    //6. A timetable of a conference hall is a list of events in a format [starting date and time; ending date and time; event’s name]. What data structure could we to be able to quickly add events and quickly check whether the hall is available in a given interval [starting date and time; ending date and time]?
    //7. Implement the data structure PriorityQueue<T>, which offers quick execution of the following operations: adding an element, extracting the smallest element.
    //8. Imagine you develop a search engine, which gathers all the advertisements for used cars in ten websites for the last few years. After that the search engine allows a quick search by one or several criteria: a brand, model, color, year of production and price. You are not allowed to use database management system (like SQL Server, MySQL or MongoDB) and you must implement your own indexing in the memory, without storing it to the hard disk and without using LINQ. When one searches by price minimal and maximal price is given. When one searches by year of production a starting and ending years are given. What data structures would you use in order to ensure fast searching by one or several criteria?
