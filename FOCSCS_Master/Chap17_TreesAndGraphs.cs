{
//1. Write a program that finds the number of occurrences of a number in a tree of numbers.
//2. Write a program that displays the roots of those sub-trees of a tree, which have exactly k nodes, where k is an integer.
//3. Write a program that finds the number of leaves and number of internal vertices of a tree.
//4. Write a program that finds in a binary tree of numbers the sum of the vertices of each level of the tree.
//5. Write a program that finds and prints all vertices of a binary tree, which have for only leaves successors.
//6. Write a program that checks whether a binary tree is perfectly balanced.
//7. Let’s have as given a graph G(V, E) and two of its vertices x and y. Write a program that finds the shortest path between two vertices measured in number of vertices staying on the path.
//8. Let’s have as given a graph G(V, E). Write a program that checks whether the graph is cyclic.
//9. Implement a recursive traversal in depth in an undirected graph and a program to test it.
//10. Write breadth first search (BFS), based on a queue, to traverse a directed graph.
//Chapter 17. Trees and Graphs 723
//11. Write a program that searches the directory C:\Windows\ and all its subdirectories recursively and prints all the files which have extension *.exe.
//12. Define classes File {string name, int size} and Folder {string name, File[] files, Folder[] childFolders}. Using these classes, build a tree that contains all files and directories on your hard disk, starting from C:\Windows\. Write a method that calculates the sum of the sizes of files in a sub-tree and a program that tests this method. To crawl the directories use recursively crawl depth (DFS).
//13. * Write a program that finds all loops in a directed graph.
//14. Let’s have as given a graph G (V, E). Write a program that finds all connected components of the graph, i.e. finds all maximal connected sub-graphs. A maximal connected sub-graph of G is a connected graph such that no other connected sub-graphs of G, contains it.
//15. Suppose we are given a weighted oriented graph G (V, E), in which the weights on the side are nonnegative numbers. Write a program that by a given vertex x from the graph finds the shortest paths from it to all other vertical.
//16. We have N tasks to be performed successively. We are given a list of pairs of tasks for which the second is dependent on the outcome of the first and should be executed after it. Write a program that arranges tasks in such a way that each task is be performed after all the tasks which it depends on have been completed. If no such order exists print an appropriate message.
//Example: {1, 2}, {2, 5}, {2, 4}, {3, 1}  3, 1, 2, 5, 4
//17. An Eulerian cycle in a graph is called a loop that starts from a vertex, passes exactly once through all edges in the graph returns to the starting vertex. Vertices can be visited repeatedly. Write a program that by a given graph, finds whether the graph has an Euler loop.
//18. A Hamiltonian cycle in a graph is a cycle containing every vertex in the graph exactly once. Write a program, which by given weighted oriented graph G (V, E), finds Hamiltonian loop with a minimum length, if such exists.
