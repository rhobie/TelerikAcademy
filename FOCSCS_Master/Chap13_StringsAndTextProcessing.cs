{
//1. Describe the strings in C#. What is typical for the string type? Explain which the most important methods of the string class are.
//2. Write a program that reads a string, reverse it and prints it to the console. For example: "introduction"  "noitcudortni".
//3. Write a program that checks whether the parentheses are placed correctly in an arithmetic expression. Example of expression with correctly placed brackets: ((a+b)/5-d). Example of an incorrect expression: )(a+b)).
//4. How many backslashes you must specify as an argument to the method Split(…) in order to split the text by a backslash?
//Example: one\two\three.
//Note: In C# backslash is an escaping character.
//5. Write a program that detects how many times a substring is contained in the text. For example, let’s look for the substring "in" in the text:
//We are living in a yellow submarine. We don't have anything else. Inside the submarine is very tight. So we are drinking all the day. We will move out of it in 5 days.
//The result is 9 occurrences.
//6. A text is given. Write a program that modifies the casing of letters to uppercase at all places in the text surrounded by <upcase> and </upcase> tags. Tags cannot be nested.
//Example:
//We are living in a <upcase>yellow submarine</upcase>. We don't have <upcase>anything</upcase> else.
//Result:
//We are living in a YELLOW SUBMARINE. We don't have ANYTHING else.
//7. Write a program that reads a string from the console (20 characters maximum) and if shorter complements it right with "*" to 20 characters.
//8. Write a program that converts a given string into the form of array of Unicode escape sequences in the format used in the C# language. Sample input: "Test". Result: "\u0054\u0065\u0073\u0074".
//9. Write a program that encrypts a text by applying XOR (excluding or) operation between the given source characters and given cipher code. The encryption should be done by applying XOR between the first letter of the text and the first letter of the code, the second letter of the text and the second letter of the code, etc. until the last letter of the code, then goes back to the first letter of the code and the next letter of the text. Print the result as a series of Unicode escape characters \xxxx.
//Sample source text: "Test". Sample cipher code: "ab". The result should be the following: "\u0035\u0007\u0012\u0016".
//10. Write a program that extracts from a text all sentences that contain a particular word. We accept that the sentences are separated from each other by the character "." and the words are separated from one another by a character which is not a letter. Sample text:
//We are living in a yellow submarine. We don't have anything else. Inside the submarine is very tight. So we are drinking
//all the day. We will move out of it in 5 days.
//Sample result:
//We are living in a yellow submarine.
//We will move out of it in 5 days.
//11. A string is given, composed of several "forbidden" words separated by commas. Also a text is given, containing those words. Write a program that replaces the forbidden words with asterisks. Sample text:
//Microsoft announced its next generation C# compiler today. It uses advanced parser and special optimizer for the Microsoft CLR.
//Sample string containing the forbidden words: "C#,CLR,Microsoft".
//Sample result:
//********* announced its next generation ** compiler today. It uses advanced parser and special optimizer for the ********* ***.
//12. Write a program that reads a number from console and prints it in 15-character field, aligned right in several ways: as a decimal number, hexadecimal number, percentage, currency and exponential (scientific) notation.
//13. Write a program that parses an URL in following format:
//[protocol]://[server]/[resource]
//It should extract from the URL the protocol, server and resource parts. For example, when http://www.cnn.com/video is passed, the result is:
//[protocol]="http"
//[server]="www.cnn.com"
//[resource]="/video"
//14. Write a program that reverses the words in a given sentence without changing punctuation and spaces. For example: "C# is not C++ and PHP is not Delphi"  "Delphi not is PHP and C++ not is C#".
//15. A dictionary is given, which consists of several lines of text. Each line consists of a word and its explanation, separated by a hyphen:
//.NET – platform for applications from Microsoft
//494 Fundamentals of Computer Programming with C#
//CLR – managed execution environment for .NET namespace – hierarchical organization of classes
//Write a program that parses the dictionary and then reads words from the console in a loop, gives an explanation for it or writes a message on the console that the word is not into the dictionary.
//16. Write a program that replaces all hyperlinks in a HTML document consisting of <a href="…">…</a> and hyperlinks in "forum" style, which look like [URL=…]…[/URL].
//Sample text:
//<p>Please visit <a href="http://softuni.org">our site</a> to choose a training course. Also visit <a href= "http://forum.softuni.org">our forum</a> to discuss the courses.</p>
//Sample result:
//<p>Please visit [URL=http://softuni.org]our site[/URL] to choose a training course. Also visit [URL= http://forum.softuni.org]our forum[/URL] to discuss the courses.</p>
//17. Write a program that reads two dates entered in the format "day.month.year" and calculates the number of days between them.
//Enter the first date: 27.02.2006
//Enter the second date: 3.03.2006
//Distance: 4 days
//18. Write a program that reads the date and time entered in the format "day.month.year hour:minutes:seconds" and prints the date and time after 6 hours and 30 minutes in the same format.
//19. Write a program that extracts all e-mail addresses from a text. These are all substrings that are limited on both sides by text end or separator between words and match the shape <sender>@<host>…<domain>. Sample text:
//Please contact us by phone (+001 222 222 222) or by email at example@gmail.com or at test.user@yahoo.co.uk. This is not email: test@test. This also: @gmail.com. Neither this: a@a.b.
//Extracted e-mail addresses from the sample text:
//example@gmail.com
//test.user@yahoo.co.uk
//20. Write a program that extracts from a text all dates written in format DD.MM.YYYY and prints them on the console in the standard format for Canada. Sample text:
//I was born at 14.06.1980. My sister was born at 3.7.1984. In 5/1999 I graduated my high school. The law says (see section 7.3.12) that we are allowed to do this (section 7.4.2.9).
//Extracted dates from the sample text:
//14.06.1980
//3.7.1984
//21. Write a program that extracts from a text all words which are palindromes, such as ABBA", "lamal", "exe".
//22. Write a program that reads a string from the console and prints in alphabetical order all letters from the input string and how many times each one of them occurs in the string.
//23. Write a program that reads a string from the console and prints in alphabetical order all words from the input string and how many times each one of them occurs in the string.
//24. Write a program that reads a string from the console and replaces every sequence of identical letters in it with a single letter (the repeating letter). Example: "aaaaabbbbbcdddeeeedssaa"  "abcdedsa".
//25. Write a program that reads a list of words separated by commas from the console and prints them in alphabetical order (after sorting).
//26. Write a program that extracts all the text without any tags and attribute values from an HTML document.
//Sample text:
//<html>
//<head><title>News</title></head>
//<body><p><a href="http://softuni.org">Software
//University</a>aims to provide free real-world practical
//training for young people who want to turn into
//skillful software engineers.</p></body>
//</html>
//Sample result:
//News
//Software University aims to provide free real-world practical training for young people who want to turn into skillful software engineers.
