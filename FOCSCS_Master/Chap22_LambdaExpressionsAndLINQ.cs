    //1. Implement an extension method Substring(int index, int length) for the class StringBuilder that returns a new StringBuilder and has the same functionality as the method Substring(…) of the class String.
    //2. Implement the following extension methods for the classes, implementing the interface IEnumerable<T>: Sum(), Min(), Max(), Average().
    //3. Write a class Student with the following properties: first name, last name and age. Write a method that for a given array of students finds those, whose first name is before their last one in alphabetical order. Use LINQ.
    //4. Create a LINQ query that finds the first and the last name of all students, aged between 18 and 24 years including. Use the class Student from the previous exercise.
    //5. By using the extension methods OrderBy(…) and ThenBy(…) with lambda expression, sort a list of students by their first and last name in descending order. Rewrite the same functionality using a LINQ query.
    //6. Write a program that prints to the console all numbers from a given array (or list), that are multiples of 7 and 3 at the same time. Use the built-in extension methods with lambda expressions and then rewrite the same using a LINQ query.
    //7. Write an extension method for the class String that capitalizes all letters, which are the beginning of a word in a sentence in English. For example: "this iS a Sample sentence." should be converted to "This Is A Sample Sentence.".
    //8. Create a hash-table to hold a phone book: a set of person names and their phone numbers (e.g. Kate Wilson  +3592981981, +3598862536; Alex & Co.  1-800-ALEX; Steve Milton  +496023456). Fill enough random data (e.g. 50,000 key-value pairs). Measure how much time it takes to perform searching by key in the hash-table using its native search capabilities, using the extension methods IEnumerable.Contains(…) and IEnumerable.Where(…). Can you explain the difference?
